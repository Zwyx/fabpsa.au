## Establishing a Bilingual Program

<p><em>FABPSA</em> is committed to collaborating with public primary schools in Perth to implement a comprehensive bilingual program. Through this program, students will have the opportunity to learn French alongside their regular academic curriculum, fostering language proficiency and cross-cultural understanding.</p>

## Encouraging Cultural Awareness

<p><em>FABPSA</em> recognises the importance of cultural awareness and appreciation in fostering global citizens. We aim to expose students to the rich and diverse Francophone culture through cultural events, workshops, and partnerships with local Francophone organisations, encouraging an understanding and respect for different cultures.</p>

## Promoting Language Acquisition

We are dedicated to creating an immersive language environment that nurtures students' language acquisition skills. By incorporating various teaching methodologies, cultural activities, and exchanges with French-speaking communities, we strive to create an engaging and dynamic learning environment.

## Supporting Professional Development

We believe in empowering educators and providing them with the necessary resources to deliver high-quality bilingual education. <em>FABPSA</em> aims to support teachers through professional development opportunities, training programs, and collaborative networks, enabling them to excel in their role as bilingual educators.

## Advocacy and Community Engagement

<p><em>FABPSA</em> serves as a platform for advocating bilingual education and raising awareness of its benefits within the wider community. We actively engage with parents, educators, policymakers, and community leaders to promote the value of bilingualism and garner support for our program.</p>
