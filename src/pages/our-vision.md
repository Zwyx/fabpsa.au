We envision a future where children in Perth have access to an outstanding bilingual education program that equips them with the language skills, cultural competences, and global perspective necessary to thrive in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world.

By integrating French language and culture into the Australian curriculum, we aim to provide students with a unique educational experience.
