# About us

## The story behind FABPSA

<Image src={children} alt="Children" width={928} height={459} />

FABPSA (French Australian Bilingual Program for School Association) is born out of the passion and determination of two French mothers, Celine and Julie, living in Perth, Western Australia.

United by their shared passion for education and as their children played and laughed together during playdates, their conversations turned to their dreams of establishing a bilingual school in their adopted city. They were perplexed by the absence of such a school in Western Australia when there were successful examples in the Eastern States. They knew that their endeavour would not be easy as similar projects failed in the last few years. Fuelled by their passion for education and determined to learn from past mistakes, they decided to give it a go. Pourquoi pas?!

They dedicated themselves to extensive research, exploring the reasons for previous failures and studying the ideal models that could work within their state's unique context. They reached out to the community, conducting surveys and seeking input to shape a vision that reflected the aspirations and needs of both the State and its residents.

Joined by a team of dedicated volunteers, they dared to take the challenge of creating the first French/English bilingual program in Perth.
