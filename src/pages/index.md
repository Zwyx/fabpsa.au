<em>FABPSA</em> is a non-for-profit organisation created in 2022 and run by volunteers who have a common passion about bilingual education. We are dedicated to promote multilingual education within the public primary school system in Perth, Australia.

Our goal is to establish a high-quality bilingual program that provides students with the opportunity to develop fluency in both French and English while fostering cultural understanding and academic excellence.

At <em>FABPSA</em>, we believe in the power of bilingualism as a valuable asset in today's interconnected world. Our organisation draws inspiration from the successful models implemented in the Eastern States that we strive to replicate within the vibrant community of Perth.
